<!-- PREMISE -->
## Premise

**Cyber bullying** has risen exponentially over the years, especially among teens. And while the traumatic experiences of the victims are well-known, little has been done by social media giants to preemptively take action. On a large scale application, merely acting on the _reported posts_ is not nearly sufficient. It is absolutely necessary to proactively participate in the prevention of cyber bullying.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/shridpant/mindhunters)

`Mindhunters` is a state-of-the-art LSTM-based NLP-algorithm on which this social media platform is wrapped. It provides sophisticated detection of texts that are violent, offensive, sexist, racist, discriminant or derogatory in nature. Scores are generated using `Mindhunters`, which affect the _reputation_ of each user. The generated scores are used to provide alerts to the social media platform, which may take appropriate action against the post and/or user. 

This project was, originally, made in our participation of <a href="https://devpost.com/software/mindhunters" target="_blank">`UB Hacking 2020`</a>.

**Note:** Due to faulty datasets, we have been unable to develop an accurate model. While the _social media site_ and its accompanying _mindhunters algorithm_ still work, **they have produced erroneous results in many circumstances**. Until we are able to obtain a satisfactory dataset to push promising updates for the mindhunters algorithm, please refain from relying on this project. 
This project **has not been deprecated** in the interest of open source collaboration. **Pull requests that resolve this (or, any!) issue are welcome!**

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Built With

The server-side application was built with Flask, Keras and NLTK. SQLite3 was employed for database management, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client-side application. `Mindhunters` was made possible by many open-sourced libraries and frameworks.

<!-- WORKING -->
### Working 

A _score_ is associated with each post that the users make. The _score_ is assigned by the sigmoid function in the output layer of `Mindhunters`. If the value of the _score_ is greater than the threshold (θ), then the post is considered to be inappropriate. _θ_ may be tuned between a value of 0 and 1, according to the required sensitivity. The _reputation_ of the users are determined by the _f(x)_, where _f_ is a function incorporating all the individual _scores_ of the posts for each user. Posts that are marked inappropriate decrease the _reputation_ of the users, while the other posts increase it.
While the _reputation_ system was created to work on the backend of the application, the current version of the Social Media publicly displays the _score_ assigned to each post and the _reputation_ associated with each user. In practise, however, these parameters may be used in he backend to evaluate reasonable actions, including reporting the users to law enforcement.

<!-- USAGE -->
### Usage

The social media platform is a web application monitored by `Mindhunters` to provide safety from cyber bullying. To execute, simply:

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/shridpant/mindhunters`. 
2. Navigate to the root folder of the project and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
3. Start your server with `python app.py`.
4. Open the address from your terminal on your browser. And you're all set!

The web application contains a number of desirable features. Examples:

1. Looking up other users

<!-- CONTACT -->
## Contact

The entire `Mindhunters` application was built by [Gaurav Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-agrawal-070599192/), [Shrid Pant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shridpant/) and [Tarun Dhankhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarundhankhar/). Please feel free to contact us with regards to the project!

## Future Works

We plan to extend the `Mindhunters` algorithm to identify misinformation (_fake news_). Further, we plan to include support for images, audios and videos.
